## What are Web Events ü§î

- "In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the _browser window_, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it ‚Äî this might be a single HTML element, set of HTML elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are a lot of different types of events that can occur, for example:

  - The user clicking the mouse over a certain element or hovering the cursor over a certain element.
  - The user pressing a key on the keyboard.
  - The user resizing or closing the browser window.
  - A web page finishing loading.
  - **A form being submitted.**
  - A video being played, or paused, or finishing play.
  - An error occurring.
- You will gather from this (and from glancing at the [MDN Event reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)) that there are a lot of events that can be responded to.

- Each available event has an **event handler**, which is a block of code (usually a user-defined **JavaScript function**) that will be run when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to be run in response to an event firing, we say we are **registering an event handler**. Note that event handlers are sometimes called **event listeners** ‚Äî they are pretty much interchangeable for our purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together. The listener **listens** out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run in response to it happening." - [MDN Introduction to Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events).
  - As it pertains to what we've seen so far, we can tell JavaScript to listen for certain events and invoke a **callback** function when that event occurs:

```js
const firstBtnOnPage = document.querySelector('button')

firstBtnOnPage.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('BUTTON WAS CLICKED')
})
```

- We are telling `addEventListener` to invoke the **anonymous function** passed as the second argument **_when_** the event fires; we're waiting for something to happen then **responding** to this user event.

---
## Listening for Events

- JavaScript allows us to [traverse the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/Locating_DOM_elements_using_selectors) and find elements. Let's see how we can target a particular element and listen for events:

- Assuming our HTML looks like this:

```html
<div id="comments">
  <h3>Comments</h3>
  <form id='comment-form'>
    <div class="field">
      <input id='new-comment' type='text' placeholder='New Comment' />
      <input type='submit' class='btn' value="Submit" />
    </div>
  </form>
  <div id="commentsContainer">
  </div>
</div>
```

- We can grab the `comment-form` and eventually listen to events:

```javascript
const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')
// OR querySelector
// const commentForm = document.querySelector('#comment-form')
```

- Something to look out for. If we are loading our js files in the `head` tag of our HTML, there is a chance that the JavaScript code we have written will start executing **before our HTML has been loaded and parsed by the browser**. This might cause some element selectors to return `null`. As a precaution, we can listen for the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
  - "The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed" - [MDN DOMContentLoaded Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded). Let's add this to our code:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function DOMContentLoadedEventHandler() {
  const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')

})
```

- In the snippet above, we are adding an **event listener** to the document and listening for the `DOMContentLoaded` event. When that event is fired, the anonymous function passed to `addEventListener` will be invoked.
  - "`addEventListener()` sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified `event` is delivered to the target. Common targets are HTML `Element`, `Document`, and `Window`" - [MDN `addEventListener` Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

- Now that we're waiting for our DOM content to load, let's listen for a `submit` event on our form:
  - "The `submit` event is fired when a form is submitted.
  - Note that `submit` is fired **only** on the form element, not the button or submit input. (Forms are submitted, not buttons.)" - [MDN Article on the `submit` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/submit)

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function DOMContentLoadedEventHandler() {
  const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')
  commentForm.addEventListener('submit', function formSubmitEventHandler(event) {
    console.log(event)
  })

})
```

- If we try adding something to the form and clicking submit, we'll see our `console.log` for a second then it will disappear.

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1L5YuA6wpKkNO/giphy.gif)

- Forms will attempt to make an HTTP `POST` request on **submission**. Recall from Mod2 that our forms would send a `POST` request that was then handled by our controller (remember HTTP and the request/response cycle?). If we give our `form` an `action` attribute, it will try to `POST` to the endpoint specified by the `action` attribute:

```html
<form id="comment-form" action="/hotdog">
  <div class="field">
    <input id='new-comment' type='text' placeholder='New Comment' />
    <input type='submit' class='btn' value="Submit" />
  </div>
</form>
```

- This form ‚¨ÜÔ∏è will try to send a `POST` request to `/hotdog`
- If our form **does not have an action attribute** it will attempt to `POST` to the URL we are currently on, making it **appear as though** our page is being refreshed. **Even though it looks like the page is being refreshed, that is not technically what is happening. The form is sending a POST request out into the void**

---

- Our current JS app is not currently sending data to a backend, so we'll need some way to **prevent** this **default** action of submitting the form ü§î

![spongebob and patrick contemplate HTML forms](https://media.giphy.com/media/TPl5N4Ci49ZQY/giphy.gif)

- Let's tell our **event handler**‚Äì‚Äìour callback function‚Äì‚Äìto `preventDefault`:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')
  commentForm.addEventListener('submit', function formSubmitEventHandler(event) {
    event.preventDefault() //stop form from POSTING
    console.log(event.target) //form
  })
})
```

- Some key points about the `event` object that is passed to our `formSubmitEventHandler` function as a parameter:
  - "The Event interface represents any event which takes place in the DOM; some are user-generated (such as mouse or keyboard events), while others are generated by APIs (such as events that indicate an animation has finished running, a video has been paused, and so forth). There are many types of events, some of which use other interfaces based on the main Event interface. Event itself contains the properties and methods which are common to all events." - [MDN Article on `Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)
  - `event.target` refers to the **HTML Element** that dispatched the event. For example, if I tell my app to listen for `click` events and the user clicks on a `p` tag, `event.target` will be the `p` tag. If the user clicks on a `button` the `event.target` will be the button. In our case, the `form` is receiving the `submit` event.
  - This is something I'd _strongly recommend_ **burning into your memory**: HTML forms will attempt to send a POST request. Any **child** of an HTML form such as an `<input/>` or `<button></button>` will **cause the form to submit**. YOU DO NOT WANT TO LISTEN FOR A CLICK EVENT IN A FORM; YOU SHOULD BE LISTENING FOR THE `submit` EVENT!!! **super important lol**

![learn to use the internet](https://media.giphy.com/media/SPZFhfUJjsJO0/giphy.gif)

- We need to grab the user's input _from the form_. That information is stored in the `input` tag **inside the form**. If we refer back to our `form` we can see that `input` is a **child** of the `form` itself:

```html
<form id="comment-form" action="/hotdog">
  <div class="field">
    <input id='new-comment' type='text' placeholder='New Comment' />
    <input type='submit' class='btn' value="Submit" />
  </div>
</form>
```

- Since our `event.target` is the `comment-form` itself, we can grab the input using `querySelector`:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function DOMContentLoadedEventHandler() {

  const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')

  commentForm.addEventListener('submit', function formSubmitEventHandler(event) {
    event.preventDefault() //stop form from POSTING

    const userInputField = event.target.querySelector('#new-comment')

    const userInputString = userInputField.value
  })

})
```

- `userInputField` will give us the whole `input` element. Since we only care about the user's new comment, we can grab the `value` attribute which will be whatever comment the user typed into the field. Refer to the [MDN Docs for `input` tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) if you're unfamiliar.

- Let's use the information the user typed into the form to add their comment to the page:

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {

  const commentsContainer = document.getElementById('commentsContainer')

  const commentForm = document.getElementById('comment-form')

  commentForm.addEventListener('submit', function formSubmitEventHandler(event) {
    event.preventDefault() //stop form from POSTING

    const userInputField = event.target.querySelector('#new-comment')

    const userInputString = userInputField.value

    const commentPTag = document.createElement('p')
    commentPTag.textContent = userInputString

    commentsContainer.appendChild(commentPTag)

  })

})
```
- "In an HTML document, the document.createElement() method creates the HTML element specified by tagName, or an HTMLUnknownElement if tagName isn't recognized." - [MDN Article on `createElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement)
  - Calling `document.createElement('p')` will create a `p` tag element.
  - This tag is an HTML object that we can _manipulate_ using JavaScript. We can change the style, or give it a particular `textContent` as a string.
- We can then `append` that `p` tag to the DOM by calling `commentsContainer.appendChild(commentPTag)`. Also note that `commentsContainer` is declared at the top of our function.

## Event Bubbling and Event Delegation

- Given a series of buttons deeply nested in some `<div></div>` tags on our page:

```html
<div id="helicopter-parent">
  <div>
    <br>
    <div>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>HI</p>
        <div>
          <button data-name="alert">Alert ME</button>
          <button data-name="log">Console Log something</button>
          <button data-name="error">Console Error</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
```

- How might we listen for events on those buttons?
  - We **could** find all the buttons, loop over that collection and attach several event listeners for our buttons. This should feel messy and hacky. There must be a better way!‚Ñ¢

### What about Event Delegation?

![event delegation diagram](https://javascript.info/article/bubbling-and-capturing/eventflow@2x.png)

- The diagram above outlines the flow of JS events from the target all the way up the DOM (tree) to the topmost node, the `Document`
  - In other words, **every HTML element will know about everything that happens to its children**

- Instead of iterating over the buttons and attaching duplicate event handlers, we can create **one** event handler to Rule Them All‚Ñ¢:

```js
const helicopterNode = document.getElementById('helicopter-parent')

helicopterNode.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  console.log(event.target) //event target will be whatever node was clicked
})
```

- Now we can introduce some control flow to our click handler and decide what to do based on which button was clicked:

```js
helicopterNode.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  // i do not need to prevent the click default action
  //event.target is the node that was clicked
  // our buttons have a key of dataset -> { name: 'alert' }
  // i am checking the value of button.dataset.name and deciding what to do based on what i find

  if (event.target.dataset.name === 'alert') {
    window.alert('HI')
  } else if (event.target.dataset.name === 'log') {
    console.log('HI')
  } else if (event.target.dataset.name === 'error') {
    console.error('HI')
  }
})
```

- _nice_

-------------------
Gotta `fetch`'em All!
===================

![pokeballs](https://media.giphy.com/media/W04QVzelTHsNW/giphy.gif)

## Objectives

- [ ] Understand why we request data asynchronously
- [ ] Create `fetch` requests (including `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM in conjunction with `fetch` calls
- [ ] Understand optimistic vs pessimistic rendering

### Deliverables (User Stories)

Expand the functionality of the JS Pokemon Search Assignment!

- [ ] As a user, I should see all the Pokemon
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to delete a Pokemon on click of a button
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to create my own Pokemon
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to edit a clicked Pokemon

These changes should _persist_ in our database.

### Mocking your own API

- Our "server" is being faked with a package called [json-server][json-server]. This package uses a local file, `db.json` to spin up a RESTful JSON API in about 30 seconds. To run your server:
  - `$ npm install -g json-server` this will install the node package (similar to a gem) globally `-g` on your machine
  - `$ json-server --watch db.json` this spins up the server, it will default to `localhost:3000`

### Sample Markdown

- We've also included a sample of the HTML that you can use to style your pokemon cards:

```html
<div class="pokemon-card">
  <div style="width:230px;margin:10px;background:#fecd2f;color:#2d72fc" class="pokemon-frame">
    <h1 class="center-text">ivysaur</h1>
    <div style="width:239px;margin:auto">
      <div style="width:96px;margin:auto">
        <img data-id="2" data-action="flip" class="toggle-sprite" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/2.png">
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Lecture Notes

### Single Page Applications (SPA)

**Why** are we doing all of this with `fetch`? ü§∑

* We want to make our User Experience (UX) feel smooth and responsive.
* No more refreshing!
* No more request <=> response for every action we want to perform.
* Instead, we will load (new) content onto the page and make changes with JavaScript.
  * Changes will be made with `fetch` and it will be asynchronous.
* For example, like Twitter
  * => No refreshing; things just happen!
  * Sometimes we have to wait, but we can have indicators to show us that stuff is happening rather than waiting for the page to refresh.

### From CRUD to FETCH

Persisting data/change? Well _crud_... how do we do that? ü§î

| CRUD              | FETCH         |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Create            | POST          |
| Read              | GET           |
| Update            | PATCH or PUT  |
| Delete / Destroy  | DELETE        |

[Using `fetch` Documentation][using-fetch-mdn]

`PUT` vs `PATCH`

The existing HTTP PUT method only allows a complete replacement of a document. This proposal adds a new HTTP method, PATCH, to modify an existing HTTP resource.

### JSON Server Routes

Minimal explanation of our API:

```
GET    /pokemon
GET    /pokemon/1
POST   /pokemon
PUT    /pokemon/1
PATCH  /pokemon/1
DELETE /pokemon/1
```

To `POST` a new Pokemon:

```
body: JSON.stringify({
  "height": 10,
  "weight": 130,
  "name": "bulbasaur",
  "abilities": ["overgrow", "chlorophyll"],
  "moves": [],
  "stats": [
    {
      "value": 80,
      "name": "special-defense"
    },
    {
      "value": 80,
      "name": "special-attack"
    },
    {
      "value": 63,
      "name": "defense"
    },
    {
      "value": 62,
      "name": "attack"
    },
    {
      "value": 60,
      "name": "speed"
    },
    {
      "value": 60,
      "name": "hp"
    }
  ],
  "types": ["grass", "poison"],
  "sprites": {
    "front": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png",
    "back": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/back/1.png"
  }
})
```

---

### Fetching ‚öæÔ∏è <== üêï

**About**

* `fetch` will always **return** a [_Promise_][mdn-promise] and it is promising to do something **if** it returns. We can think of this as the **promise** of an eventual value
  * There is **NO** guarantee of when it will come back!
  * There is **NO** guarantee that it will succeed!
* We **want** `fetch` to be **asynchronous _BECAUSE_**:
  * **If** `fetch` calls were **synchronous**, we would be stuck waiting for the call to finish before the code could proceed.
  * So **rather than _blocking_** any other JavaScript from running, we want `fetch` calls to be asynchronous. We want to write code around the eventual success or failure of some _asynchronous_ ‚è≥ operation such as an HTTP request.

**Usage**

* The `body` data **HAS** to be a string in a `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` `fetch` call.
* You need `headers` in `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` to tell the server what kind of content (`Content-Type`) you are sending to it. For example:
  * `'Content-Type': 'application/json'` is telling the server that you are sending a string of JSON in the `body` of your `fetch` request. You can [read more about the different types of data that can be sent here][mdn-mime-types]

---

## Optimistic vs Pessimistic Rendering

#### Optimistic

* You can manipulate the DOM synchronously (outside the `.then()`).
* This is referred to as optimist rendering because you are **not waiting** for the async response to resolve.

**Pros**:
* Super responsive! User Experience++!

**Cons**:
* `fetch`es (aka: the "Promise") can lie!! If the `fetch` fails, data can become out of sync.
* `fetch`es are also **NOT** guaranteed to run in order.
  * What if we create a Pokemon and then update it relying all on optimistic rendering? The `PATCH` might reach the server _before_ your `POST`!!

Very interesting example of optimistic rendering that is handled _robustly_: **Reddit**

> When you vote, your vote isn‚Äôt instantly processed‚Äîinstead, it‚Äôs placed into a queue.
>
> Source: [Caching at Reddit](https://redditblog.com/2017/1/17/caching-at-reddit/)

[Hacker News commenter's insight](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13433793):

> I remember looking into this a while ago and was bewildered to find that when I upvoted or downvoted, there was no XHR call to the backend! There was no hidden iframe/image, no silent form post. Absolutely no network activity. Yet when I refreshed, my vote was shown correctly. I thought I was going crazy.
>
> This was long ago so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details but after a bit of digging, I found the most elegant data collection technique I've ever seen. Instead of sending network data when I voted, a local cookie was set with the link id and vote value. Then when I went to another page, my browser naturally sent the cookie to the server, where I believe it was processed, and then a fresh cookie was sent back to my browser. I could vote on 10 links, the local cookie would get large and then on the next page refresh, the backend would receive my batch of votes, process them, and send me a fresh cookie again.

#### Pessimistic

* You can manipulate the DOM asynchronously (inside the `.then()`) using the response from the server.
* Doing this is called pessimistic rendering because you **are waiting until** the async response has return to complete the action. In other words, you're pessimistic about the success of the request.
* This is to make sure the data on your page is consistent with the database.

**Pros**:
* What is reflected in the _client_ will always be in sync with the _server_.

**Cons**:
* If the `fetch` is slow, the UI will appear to not respond! (**hint** maybe good UX will signal to the user that something is happening)

![loading spinner](https://media.giphy.com/media/jAYUbVXgESSti/giphy.gif)

Example of a feature you might want to always do pessimistically: **user signup**

* Think about registration forms on the web. What to do they normally all do?
  * Disable things once you submit?
  * Show a spinner?
  * Anything else?
* You want to confirm that a new user was successfully created before redirecting your user somewhere. In this case, pessimistic rendering is preferable.

## Updating the DOM

As the developer, _it is your job to decide whether optimistic or pessimistic rendering is appropriate_. You must then remember to update the data **everywhere** that it is kept. At a **minimum**, this means:

1. `fetch` for making changes to your database
2. DOM manipulation for updating what the user sees in the browser

_But wait, there's more!_

3. Did you store any data in JavaScript variables?
  * Update them!

These steps are you being aware of _how_ **your** application is built.

**Considerations** for #1, #2, #3, etc...:

1. Where should you put that `fetch`?
  * When do you want it to be sent? ü§î
  * Perhaps on some sort of `event`? ü§îü§î
  * Maybe I can _listen_ for a certain type of `event`? ü§îü§îü§î
  * I wonder where I can _add_ that _`event`_ _listener_? ü§îü§îü§îü§î
  * Maybe somewhere where we can _delegate_ that responsibility? ü§îü§îü§îü§îü§î
2. How can we update the DOM?
  * JavaScript has a **TON** of ways to accomplish the same task. Some are more hacky than others. Some are better than others. However, **always** remember: Red, Green, Refactor!
  * **Do what you know** to work before you try and make it better!
  * Some example strategies for manipulating the DOM:
    * Rerender is all! üôå
    * `appendChild` ü§± (just make sure to construct the whole node to append)
    * Add to `innerHTML` +=
    * `event.currentTarget` to find what the event listener is attached to (where everything bubbles up to) üëÇ
    * Climbing the tree üßó‚Äçüå≤:
      * `event.target.parentElement` or `event.target.parentNode` for looking up the tree ([difference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8685739/difference-between-dom-parentnode-and-parentelement))
      * `event.target.children` for looking down the tree
    * `removeChild` üòµ
    * Learn to use the MDN docs!
3. This is just pure JavaScript. Change your global data using things like `filter`, `push`, etc.
  * **HOWEVER!** Remember to take note of which methods are destructive and which are NOT!
  * If you don't remember, look it up! Google, StackOverflow, MDN, think of them as your "phone a friend". ‚òéÔ∏è
  * For example: `filter` does not mutate while `push` does! Consistency? Naming conventions? What do you think we are, Ruby? üíéü§£

**Et cetera!**

As you are adding functionality (those things above), there will be times where you will need to add, remove, or change the base HTML in order to be able to accomplish the task. Remember that you are the developer. **You get to decide how the HTML looks!**

For example:

- new elements (`<button>`, `<form>`)
- more attributes (`data-id`, `data-action`)
- renaming attributes that make no sense (class: `pokemon-container` => `pokemon-card`)

```html
<div data-id="1" class="pokemon-card">
  <div style="width:230px;margin:10px;background:#fecd2f;color:#2d72fc" class="pokemon-frame">
    <h1 class="center-text">bulbasaur</h1>
    <div style="width:239px;margin:auto">
      <div style="width:96px;margin:auto">
        <img name="flip" data-id="1" data-action="flip" class="toggle-sprite" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/1.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <button data-action="delete" class="pokebutton" style="width: 230px;margin:auto;">Delete</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
